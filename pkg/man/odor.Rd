}
\format{
  A data frame with 35 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{odor}}{a numeric vector}
    \item{\code{yellowing}}{a numeric vector}
    \item{\code{hardness}}{a numeric vector}
  }
}
\details{
  These data are quality data gathered from 35 random samples of a raw
  material used in a lens coating.  It is beneficial to understand the
  relationships between desired quality characteristics of a product as
  one must often compromise one characteristic for another.
